# Layer this on top of config/default-single-timestep.yaml to keep only a
# curated set of generation and storage carriers. Intended as the default
# "extra functionality" test that exercises scripts/extra/limit_core_technologies.py.
#
# IMPORTANT: This override should use the same geographic and nodal scope as the base config.
# When updating base config countries or clusters, ensure they match here.
# Current alignment: 17-country reduced set, 70 clusters (matching day-threehour.yaml).
